# Phase 1: Database Foundation üóÑÔ∏è

**Epic Milestone**: Database Architecture Complete  
**Target**: Weeks 1-2  
**Dependencies**: None

## Component: Database Architecture

### Issue #1: Create Multiple Translations Schema

**Labels**: `epic:reflexive-verbs` `priority:critical` `phase:1` `story-points:8` `type:technical` `component:database`

**As a** developer  
**I want** to create the new database tables for word translations and form translation assignments  
**So that** we can support multiple translations per word with proper form assignment and display prioritization

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] `word_translations` table created with proper foreign key to existing `dictionary` table
- [ ] `form_translations` table created linking to existing `word_forms` and new `word_translations` tables  
- [ ] `user_form_translation_progress` table created extending existing `user_word_progress` pattern (placeholder for future SRS)
- [ ] All foreign key constraints properly configured with CASCADE deletes to `dictionary.id`
- [ ] `display_priority` column added for card ordering
- [ ] `context_metadata` JSONB field for usage context information
- [ ] Database migration script tested on development environment with existing 21 words + 432 forms

**Technical Implementation:**

```sql
-- WORD TRANSLATIONS: Multiple translations per word
CREATE TABLE word_translations (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  word_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES dictionary(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  translation text NOT NULL, -- 'to speak', 'to talk', 'hello', 'goodbye'
  display_priority integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 1, -- 1 = primary/most common
  context_metadata jsonb DEFAULT '{}', -- {"usage": "formal", "situations": ["presentations", "interviews"]}
  usage_notes text, -- "Used in formal situations"
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now()
);

-- FORM TRANSLATIONS: Assignment of forms to specific word translations
CREATE TABLE form_translations (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  form_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES word_forms(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  word_translation_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES word_translations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  translation text NOT NULL, -- 'I speak', 'he/she talks', etc.
  usage_examples jsonb DEFAULT '[]', -- [{"italian": "Parlo italiano", "english": "I speak Italian"}]
  assignment_method text DEFAULT 'automatic', -- 'automatic', 'manual', 'calculated-variant'
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE(form_id, word_translation_id) -- One assignment per form per word translation
);

-- SRS PROGRESS: Placeholder for future SRS Epic  
CREATE TABLE user_form_translation_progress (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid NOT NULL,
  form_translation_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES form_translations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  deck_id uuid REFERENCES decks(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  
  -- SRS Algorithm fields (matches existing user_word_progress)
  difficulty_factor numeric DEFAULT 2.5,
  interval_days integer DEFAULT 1,
  repetitions integer DEFAULT 0,
  correct_streak integer DEFAULT 0,
  total_reviews integer DEFAULT 0,
  correct_reviews integer DEFAULT 0,
  last_reviewed timestamp with time zone,
  next_review timestamp with time zone,
  average_response_time numeric,
  difficulty_adjustments integer DEFAULT 0,
  
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, form_translation_id, deck_id)
);
```

**Definition of Done:**

- [ ] All three tables created with proper constraints and indexes
- [ ] Migration script tested preserving all existing 21 dictionary entries and 432 word forms
- [ ] Integration confirmed with existing `word_audio_metadata` pattern
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing `dictionary` or `word_forms` table structure

### Issue #2: Migrate Existing Dictionary Data with Translation Matching

**Labels**: `epic:reflexive-verbs` `priority:critical` `phase:1` `story-points:5` `type:technical` `component:database`

**As a** developer  
**I want** to migrate existing dictionary entries using translation matching logic  
**So that** current words gain multiple translations while preserving all existing form relationships

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] All 21 existing dictionary entries analyzed for multiple translations in English field
- [ ] Multiple translations split into separate `word_translations` entries:
  - `ciao` "hello, goodbye" ‚Üí 2 word_translations with priorities 1,2
  - `parlare` "to speak, to talk" ‚Üí 2 word_translations with priorities 1,2
  - `casa` "house, home" ‚Üí 2 word_translations with priorities 1,2
  - etc.
- [ ] Single-meaning words get single `word_translations` entry with priority 1
- [ ] All 432 existing `word_forms.translation` values migrated using **translation matching**:
  - Form "I speak" ‚Üí assigned to word_translation "to speak" (priority 1)
  - Form "I talk" ‚Üí would be assigned to word_translation "to talk" (priority 2) if it existed
- [ ] Context metadata populated based on translation analysis
- [ ] No data loss during migration
- [ ] Rollback plan tested

**Translation Matching Logic:**

```sql
-- Migration Logic: Match form translations to word translations
-- Example: parlare has word_translations ["to speak", "to talk"]
-- Form "I speak" matches word_translation "to speak"
-- Form "I talk" matches word_translation "to talk"

WITH form_assignment AS (
  SELECT 
    wf.id as form_id,
    wf.translation as form_translation,
    wt.id as word_translation_id,
    wt.translation as word_translation,
    CASE 
      WHEN wf.translation ILIKE '%speak%' AND wt.translation ILIKE '%speak%' THEN 'match'
      WHEN wf.translation ILIKE '%talk%' AND wt.translation ILIKE '%talk%' THEN 'match'
      -- Add more matching rules...
      ELSE 'no-match'
    END as match_quality
  FROM word_forms wf
  JOIN word_translations wt ON wt.word_id = wf.word_id
  WHERE wf.translation IS NOT NULL
)
-- Forms get assigned to best matching word_translation
```

**Special Cases:**

- **Reflexive verbs**: Use existing tags system for context-specific forms
- **Compound tenses**: Inherit assignment from base form
- **Gender variants**: Use calculated-variant assignment method
- **Ambiguous forms**: Default to priority 1 (most common) translation

**Definition of Done:**

- [ ] At least 6 words have multiple `word_translations` (bello, bene, casa, ciao, grande, parlare)
- [ ] All 432 forms have `form_translations` entries with proper `word_translation_id` assignment
- [ ] Translation matching achieves 90%+ automatic assignment rate
- [ ] Manual assignment needed for <10% of forms
- [ ] Priority ordering enables proper display in UI

### Issue #3: Create Reflexive Verb Test Data with Translation Focus

**Labels**: `epic:reflexive-verbs` `priority:high` `phase:1` `story-points:3` `type:technical` `component:database`

**As a** developer  
**I want** to create comprehensive test data for "lavarsi" using the translation-first architecture  
**So that** we can test and demonstrate the multiple translations functionality with reflexive verb complexity

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] "lavarsi" entry created with appropriate reflexive tags
- [ ] Two word translations created:
  - Translation 1: "to wash oneself" (priority 1, direct reflexive)
  - Translation 2: "to wash each other" (priority 2, reciprocal) 
- [ ] Complete present tense conjugations created with proper translation assignment:
  - "mi lavo" ‚Üí assigned to "to wash oneself" (only valid assignment)
  - "ci laviamo" ‚Üí can be assigned to either translation (demonstrate choice)
  - "si lavano" ‚Üí can be assigned to either translation
- [ ] Context metadata populated with usage information
- [ ] Form assignment demonstrates translation matching logic
- [ ] Gender variants work with VariantCalculator integration
- [ ] Usage examples created for key translation distinctions

**Test Data Architecture:**

```sql
-- lavarsi word translations
INSERT INTO word_translations (word_id, translation, display_priority, context_metadata) VALUES
(lavarsi_id, 'to wash oneself', 1, '{"usage": "direct-reflexive", "plurality": "any"}'),
(lavarsi_id, 'to wash each other', 2, '{"usage": "reciprocal", "plurality": "plural-only"}');

-- Form assignments using translation matching
-- "mi lavo" = "I wash myself" ‚Üí matches "to wash oneself"
-- "ci laviamo" could be "we wash ourselves" OR "we wash each other" 
--   ‚Üí demonstrates choice/context via tags or metadata
```

**Special Reflexive Handling:**

- Use existing `tags` system to mark reciprocal-capable forms
- Singular forms (mi, ti, si) ‚Üí only "to wash oneself" translation
- Plural forms (ci, vi, si) ‚Üí can use either translation based on context
- Context switching in UI will filter translations by form appropriateness

**Definition of Done:**

- [ ] "lavarsi" demonstrates multiple translation functionality
- [ ] Translation assignment logic handles reflexive complexity
- [ ] Context metadata enables appropriate form filtering
- [ ] Integration with existing VariantCalculator confirmed
- [ ] Architecture serves as template for other reflexive verbs
- [ ] Card display prioritization works correctly
