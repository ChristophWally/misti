# Phase 1: Database Foundation üóÑÔ∏è

**Epic Milestone**: Database Architecture Complete  
**Target**: Weeks 1-2  
**Dependencies**: None

## Component: Database Architecture

You're absolutely right! Looking at your document, you need to overwrite **Issue #1: Create Multiple Translations Schema**.

Here's the exact text to replace that section:

---

### Issue #1: Create Multiple Translations Schema

**Labels**: `epic:reflexive-verbs` `priority:critical` `phase:1` `story-points:8` `type:technical` `component:database`

**As a** developer  
**I want** to create the new database tables for semantic contexts and form translations  
**So that** we can support multiple meanings per reflexive verbs while preserving existing data

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] `word_semantic_contexts` table created with proper foreign key to existing `dictionary` table
- [ ] `form_translations` table created linking to existing `word_forms` and new `word_semantic_contexts` tables  
- [ ] `user_form_translation_progress` table created extending existing `user_word_progress` pattern
- [ ] All foreign key constraints properly configured with CASCADE deletes to `dictionary.id`
- [ ] GIN indexes created on JSONB fields for performance (`context_links`, `usage_examples`)
- [ ] Integration with existing `word_audio_metadata` source_table/source_id pattern verified
- [ ] Database migration script tested on development environment with existing 21 words + 432 forms

**Technical Implementation:**

```sql
-- SEMANTIC CONTEXTS: Multiple meanings per word
CREATE TABLE word_semantic_contexts (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  word_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES dictionary(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  context_type text NOT NULL, -- 'direct-reflexive', 'reciprocal', 'indirect-reflexive'
  context_name text NOT NULL, -- 'Wash Oneself', 'Wash Each Other'  
  base_translation text NOT NULL, -- 'to wash oneself', 'to wash each other'
  semantic_tags text[] DEFAULT '{}', -- ['self-directed', 'body-care']
  frequency_rank integer DEFAULT 1, -- 1 = most common meaning
  context_links jsonb DEFAULT '[]', -- [{"word_id": "uuid", "link_type": "synonym"}]
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now()
);

-- FORM TRANSLATIONS: Context-specific translations for existing word_forms
CREATE TABLE form_translations (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  form_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES word_forms(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  semantic_context_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES word_semantic_contexts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  translation text NOT NULL, -- 'we wash ourselves' vs 'we wash each other'
  usage_examples jsonb DEFAULT '[]', -- [{"italian": "Ci laviamo", "english": "We wash ourselves"}]
  context_notes text, -- Additional pedagogical explanations
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE(form_id, semantic_context_id) -- One translation per form per context
);

-- SRS PROGRESS: Extends existing pattern to track per form+context combination  
CREATE TABLE user_form_translation_progress (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid NOT NULL, -- Matches existing user_word_progress pattern
  form_translation_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES form_translations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  deck_id uuid REFERENCES decks(id) ON DELETE SET NULL, -- Optional deck association
  
  -- SRS Algorithm fields (matches existing user_word_progress exactly)
  difficulty_factor numeric DEFAULT 2.5,
  interval_days integer DEFAULT 1,
  repetitions integer DEFAULT 0,
  correct_streak integer DEFAULT 0,
  total_reviews integer DEFAULT 0,
  correct_reviews integer DEFAULT 0,
  last_reviewed timestamp with time zone,
  next_review timestamp with time zone,
  average_response_time numeric,
  difficulty_adjustments integer DEFAULT 0,
  
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, form_translation_id, deck_id)
);
```

**Definition of Done:**

- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Migration script tested preserving all existing 21 dictionary entries and 432 word forms
- [ ] All foreign key constraints validated (CASCADE from dictionary.id works correctly)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements (<100ms for complex context queries)
- [ ] Integration confirmed with existing `word_audio_metadata.source_table = 'word_forms'` pattern
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing `dictionary` or `word_forms` table structure

### Issue #2: Migrate Existing Dictionary Data

**Labels**: `epic:reflexive-verbs` `priority:critical` `phase:1` `story-points:5` `type:technical` `component:database`

**As a** developer  
**I want** to migrate existing dictionary entries (21 words, 432 forms) to the new schema structure  
**So that** current words continue to work while gaining multiple translation capabilities

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] All 21 existing dictionary entries preserved without data loss
- [ ] Default semantic context created for each existing word with `context_type = 'primary-meaning'`
- [ ] All 432 existing word_forms.translation values migrated to new form_translations table
- [ ] Each existing form linked to its word's default semantic context
- [ ] Extensive conjugation data for "parlare" and "andare" (160+ forms) preserved correctly
- [ ] Existing word_audio_metadata relationships maintained (2 current records)
- [ ] Existing word_relationships preserved (2 current records)
- [ ] Migration script includes rollback plan tested on development environment
- [ ] No downtime during migration process

**Migration Strategy:**

```sql
-- Step 1: Create default contexts for all existing words
INSERT INTO word_semantic_contexts (word_id, context_type, context_name, base_translation, frequency_rank)
SELECT 
  id,
  'primary-meaning',
  CASE word_type
    WHEN 'VERB' THEN 'Primary Usage'
    WHEN 'NOUN' THEN 'Common Meaning'
    WHEN 'ADJECTIVE' THEN 'Standard Form'
    WHEN 'ADVERB' THEN 'Basic Usage'
  END,
  english, -- Use existing english field as base_translation
  1 -- Primary meaning gets rank 1
FROM dictionary;

-- Step 2: Migrate all word_forms.translation to form_translations
INSERT INTO form_translations (form_id, semantic_context_id, translation)
SELECT 
  wf.id,
  wsc.id,
  COALESCE(wf.translation, wf.form_text) -- Use translation if exists, fallback to form_text
FROM word_forms wf
JOIN word_semantic_contexts wsc ON wsc.word_id = wf.word_id
WHERE wsc.context_type = 'primary-meaning';

-- Step 3: Verify migration completeness
-- All 432 forms should have form_translations entries
```

**Definition of Done:**

- [ ] Pre-migration backup created and verified
- [ ] All 432 word forms have corresponding form_translations entries
- [ ] All 21 words have primary semantic contexts created
- [ ] Data integrity verified: no orphaned records
- [ ] Performance tests confirm <200ms query times post-migration
- [ ] Rollback script tested and documented

### Issue #3: Create Reflexive Verb Test Data

**Labels**: `epic:reflexive-verbs` `priority:high` `phase:1` `story-points:3` `type:technical` `component:database`

**As a** developer  
**I want** to create comprehensive test data for "lavarsi" with multiple semantic contexts  
**So that** we can test and demonstrate the multiple meanings functionality

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] "lavarsi" entry created with reflexive-verb tags
- [ ] Two semantic contexts created:
  - Direct reflexive: "Wash Oneself" (`context_type: 'direct-reflexive'`)
  - Reciprocal: "Wash Each Other" (`context_type: 'reciprocal'`)
- [ ] Complete present indicative conjugations (6 forms) created for lavarsi
- [ ] Context-specific translations for each form in both meanings:
  - "ci laviamo" ‚Üí "we wash ourselves" (direct) vs "we wash each other" (reciprocal)
  - "si lavano" ‚Üí "they wash themselves" (direct) vs "they wash each other" (reciprocal)
- [ ] Usage examples created for key forms demonstrating context differences
- [ ] Audio metadata placeholders created following existing pattern
- [ ] Related word links created (sapone, asciugamano for direct; insieme, aiutarsi for reciprocal)

**Test Data Structure:**

```sql
-- Dictionary entry
INSERT INTO dictionary (italian, english, word_type, tags) VALUES
('lavarsi', 'to wash', 'VERB', ARRAY[
  'reflexive-verb', 'are-conjugation', 'essere-auxiliary', 
  'both-transitivity', 'freq-top1000', 'CEFR-A2'
]);

-- Semantic contexts  
INSERT INTO word_semantic_contexts (word_id, context_type, context_name, base_translation, semantic_tags) VALUES
(lavarsi_id, 'direct-reflexive', 'Wash Oneself', 'to wash oneself', ARRAY['self-directed', 'personal-care']),
(lavarsi_id, 'reciprocal', 'Wash Each Other', 'to wash each other', ARRAY['mutual-action', 'cooperative']);

-- Sample key forms with dual translations
-- "ci laviamo" with both meanings
-- "si lavano" with both meanings  
-- "mi lavo" (only direct - singular can't be reciprocal)
```

**Context-Specific Examples:**

- **Direct Reflexive**: "Mi lavo le mani prima di mangiare" ‚Üí "I wash my hands before eating"
- **Reciprocal**: "Ci laviamo a vicenda dopo il lavoro" ‚Üí "We wash each other after work"
- **Usage Notes**: Reciprocal meaning requires plural subject (noi, voi, loro only)

**Definition of Done:**

- [ ] "lavarsi" fully functional in dictionary search
- [ ] Context switching works in conjugation modal
- [ ] Gender variants generate correctly for compound tenses
- [ ] Related words display per context appropriately
- [ ] Integration with existing VariantCalculator confirmed
- [ ] Test data serves as template for additional reflexive verbs
