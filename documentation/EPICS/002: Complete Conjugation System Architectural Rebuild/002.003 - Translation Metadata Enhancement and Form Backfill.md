# Story 002.003: Translation Metadata Enhancement and Form Backfill

**Epic**: Complete Conjugation System Architectural Rebuild

**As a** developer
**I want** to complete translation metadata and systematically backfill missing building block forms
**So that** all existing verbs have the required foundation forms and accurate auxiliary assignments

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Translation metadata enhanced** in `word_translations.context_metadata` with complete auxiliary assignments, usage constraints, and plurality restrictions
- **Translation auxiliary consistency validated** to ensure auxiliary assignments match actual Italian grammatical requirements for each semantic meaning
- **Systematic backfill executed** for missing past participles and gerunds in existing dictionary verbs requiring building blocks for compound materialization
- **Reflexive verb validation implemented** with special handling for reciprocal vs direct-reflexive semantic distinctions and plurality constraints
- **Invariable form validation** for infinito-passato and gerundio-passato forms with proper `person-invariable` tagging
- **Building block completeness verified** ensuring all existing dictionary verbs have required forms for future compound materialization
- **Translation-form mapping validation** confirms every translation has populated `form_ids` with existing forms and consistent auxiliary tags
- **Gender variant calculation integrated** with clitic agreement rules for base word reflexive forms only
- **Translation constraint filtering system built** with usage-driven form filtering based on plurality restrictions and semantic constraints
- **Foundation data quality assured** with â‰¥95% of existing verbs meeting structural compliance for architectural readiness
