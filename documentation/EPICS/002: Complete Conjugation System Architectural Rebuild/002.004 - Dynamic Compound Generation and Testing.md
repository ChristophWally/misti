# Story 002.004: Dynamic Compound Generation and Testing

**Epic**: Complete Conjugation System Architectural Rebuild

**As a** developer
**I want** reliable compound form generation with full clitic support
**So that** all complex tenses render correctly with pronunciation

## Acceptance Criteria
- `CliticOrchestrator` module implemented with comprehensive pronoun handling architecture, including reflexive pronouns, direct object pronouns, and indirect object pronouns with systematic ordering rules for multiple clitic combinations
- Dynamic compound form generation supports clitics and pronunciation output
- Clitic placement context awareness across finite verbs, infinitives, imperatives, and gerunds
- Multiple pronoun ordering validation for indirect before direct and reflexive before direct object combinations
- Enclitic attachment integrates correct phonetic transformations through the `PronunciationEngine`
- Comprehensive unit tests created for clitic placement, imperative forms and IPA accuracy
- Progressive, negative, and reciprocal cases covered in test matrix
- Scope compliance verification flags non-base clitics, negative forms, or complex constructions beyond current scope
