# Story 002.001: Foundation Data Architecture and Universal Terminology Migration

**Epic**: Complete Conjugation System Architectural Rebuild

**As a** developer
**I want** to establish the core data architecture foundations and migrate to universal terminology
**So that** the new system starts from a clean, language-agnostic foundation with explicit relationships

## Acceptance Criteria
- Auxiliary patterns extracted to static development file `src/lib/auxPatterns.ts` (development tool only, not runtime cache)
- Universal terminology migration executed across all existing `word_forms.tags` and `dictionary.tags` (e.g., "io" → "first-person", "presente" → "present")
- Display layer mapping implemented to maintain Italian-specific UI labels while using universal terms internally
- Explicit auxiliary tags added to all compound forms in existing `word_forms` (`avere-auxiliary`, `essere-auxiliary`, `stare-auxiliary`)
- Direct foreign key relationship established from `word_forms` to `dictionary` table for efficient form lookup
- Auxiliary tag accuracy validation ensures ≥99% of compound forms have correct explicit auxiliary tags matching their form structure
- Form structure analysis completed using `FormGapAnalyzer` to identify missing building blocks across existing dictionary verbs
- Tag consistency audit executed to identify and flag inconsistencies in existing tag systems across all tables
- Irregular forms flagged with `irregular` tag in existing `word_forms` for past participles, gerunds, and imperatives
