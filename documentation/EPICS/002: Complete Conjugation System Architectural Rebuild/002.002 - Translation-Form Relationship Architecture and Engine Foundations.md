# Story 002.002: Translation-Form Relationship Architecture and Engine Foundations

**Epic**: Complete Conjugation System Architectural Rebuild

**As a** developer
**I want** to implement the core translation-to-form relationship architecture and engine foundations
**So that** the system can efficiently retrieve forms based on semantic meaning rather than complex filtering

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Translation-to-form architecture implemented** with `form_ids` arrays in `word_translations` table pointing to specific forms for each meaning
- **ConjugationEngine class built** with translation-driven form retrieval methods using direct form_ids lookup
- **Database query optimization implemented** with single comprehensive query loading all verb data (word, translations, forms, form_translations) in sub-200ms
- **Translation form reference validation** ensures all form_ids arrays contain valid references to existing forms with consistent auxiliary tags
- **PronunciationEngine created** with phonetic transformation rules for gender variants and base word clitic pronunciation
- **Auxiliary pattern caching implemented** with performance monitoring for development-time materialization tools
- **Progressive form token recognition implemented** including systematic `stare` auxiliary pattern detection
- **Database indexing strategy deployed** on universal terminology fields and foreign key relationships for optimal performance
- **Form retrieval architecture tested** to ensure translation switching completes in under 100ms by loading only specified forms
- **Memory efficiency validated** through direct form retrieval rather than generate-and-filter approaches
