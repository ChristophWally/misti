# Story 002.007: Tag Standardization and Quality Assurance

**Epic**: Complete Conjugation System Architectural Rebuild

**As a** developer
**I want** consistent tags and automated validation
**So that** the data remains reliable throughout migration

## Acceptance Criteria
- Tag standardization migration executed using `TagMigrationValidator`
- Manual verification completed for updated forms and tags
- Basic data consistency checks implemented to validate tag updates
- Feature flag system added for gradual rollout with A/B testing
- Performance monitoring added with alerting on >300ms queries
- Linguistic expert review completed using standardized workflow
- Automated data quality assurance framework in admin tools with continuous validation rules
- Materialization readiness reporting system identifies verbs ready for future engine
- Word conjugation validator integrated into admin tools with real-time compliance reporting and ≥95% accuracy
- Validation ensures each translation has populated `form_ids` with existing forms and consistent auxiliary tags
- Architectural readiness assessment shows ≥90% of verbs meet structural compliance with remediation paths
- Scope boundary validation confirms only base clitics stored, no negative forms or complex constructions
- Admin interface provides actionable feedback for non-technical stakeholders
- Linguistic quality assurance verifies reflexive translations meet plurality constraints, auxiliaries match grammatical requirements, and form-to-translation mappings remain semantically coherent
