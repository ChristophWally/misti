# Story 002.006: Accessibility and UI Enhancements

**Epic**: Complete Conjugation System Architectural Rebuild

**As a** learner using assistive technology
**I want** the modal to meet accessibility standards
**So that** the interface is usable for everyone

## Acceptance Criteria
- Imperative mood complexity handled (irregular forms, enclitics, negatives)
- Orthographic refinement layer applies apostrophes and capitalization correctly
- Formality mapping logic implemented with pronoun capitalization
- WCAG 2.2 AA compliance with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support for base clitic constructions
- Existing accessibility behavior maintained without regressions
- Loading states and error handling added for all async operations
