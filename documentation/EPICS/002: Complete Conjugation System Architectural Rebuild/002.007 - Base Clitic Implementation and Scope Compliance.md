# Story 002.007: Base Clitic Implementation and Scope Compliance

**Epic**: Complete Conjugation System Architectural Rebuild

**As a** developer
**I want** to implement base word clitic support with strict scope boundaries
**So that** reflexive verbs work correctly within current architectural limitations while establishing foundations for future expansion

### Acceptance Criteria
- **CliticOrchestrator module implemented** for base reflexive pronoun handling only (mi lavo, mi sono lavato patterns)
- **Base clitic scope validation** ensures only inherent word-level clitics are stored, with complex constructions explicitly excluded
- **Gender variant calculation** for base masculine forms with limited clitic agreement support for reflexive constructions
- **Clitic placement validation** for base reflexive forms with correct pronoun positioning and past participle agreement
- **Scope boundary enforcement** preventing storage of enclitic attachment, complex clitic combinations, or negative constructions
- **Reflexive auxiliary selection** validated for essere compounds with proper gender agreement for base forms
- **Base clitic pronunciation** integrated with PronunciationEngine for gender variants and standard reflexive patterns
- **Exclusion validation framework** automatically detecting and flagging non-base clitic constructions that exceed current scope
- **Foundation architecture** established for future clitic expansion without requiring core system refactoring
- **Clitic validation matrix** covering base reflexive forms, gender agreement, auxiliary consistency, and scope compliance boundaries
