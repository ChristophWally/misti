# Story 002.001: Foundation Data Analysis and Tag Audits

**Epic**: Complete Conjugation System Architectural Rebuild

**As a** developer
**I want** to analyze existing conjugation data and audit verb tags
**So that** the new architecture starts from a clean and well understood dataset

## Acceptance Criteria
- Auxiliary patterns moved to `src/lib/auxPatterns.ts`
- Data gap analysis executed with `FormGapAnalyzer` for existing verbs in dictionary table
- Automated audit run for `word_forms.tags` and `dictionary.tags`
- Irregular forms flagged with `irregular` tag in `word_forms`
