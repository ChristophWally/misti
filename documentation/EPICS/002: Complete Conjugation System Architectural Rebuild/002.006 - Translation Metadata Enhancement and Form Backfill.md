# Story 002.006: Translation Metadata Enhancement and Form Backfill

**Epic**: Complete Conjugation System Architectural Rebuild

**As a** developer
**I want** to complete translation metadata and systematically backfill missing foundational forms—past participles, present gerunds, present infinitives, and base imperatives—identified by mood and tense
**So that** all existing verbs have the required foundation forms and accurate auxiliary assignments

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Translation metadata enhanced** in `word_translations.context_metadata` with complete auxiliary assignments, usage constraints, and plurality restrictions
- **Translation auxiliary consistency validated** to ensure auxiliary assignments match actual Italian grammatical requirements for each semantic meaning
- **Systematic backfill executed** for missing past participles, present gerunds, present infinitives, and base imperatives in existing dictionary verbs, using mood and tense tags alone to locate required building blocks for compound materialization
- **Reflexive verb validation implemented** with special handling for reciprocal vs direct-reflexive semantic distinctions and plurality constraints
- **Invariable form validation** for infinito-passato and gerundio-passato forms with proper `person-invariable` tagging
- **Building block completeness verified** ensuring all existing dictionary verbs have required forms for future compound materialization based solely on mood and tense tags:
  - Past Participle — mood `participio`, tense `participio-passato`
  - Present Gerund — mood `gerundio`, tense `gerundio-presente`
  - Present Infinitive — mood `infinito`, tense `infinito-presente`
  - Base Imperative — mood `imperativo`, tense `imperativo-presente`
- **Translation-form mapping validation** confirms every translation has populated `form_ids` with existing forms and consistent auxiliary tags
- **Gender variant calculation integrated** with clitic agreement rules for base word reflexive forms only
- **Translation constraint filtering system built** with usage-driven form filtering based on plurality restrictions and semantic constraints
- **Foundation data quality assured** with ≥95% of existing verbs meeting structural compliance for architectural readiness
