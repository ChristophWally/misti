# Story 002.002: Admin Tools Validation Interface Development

**Epic**: Complete Conjugation System Architectural Rebuild

**As a** developer and linguistic expert
**I want** comprehensive admin tools interface for conjugation validation and compliance monitoring
**So that** data quality can be monitored and issues identified BEFORE making architectural changes

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Auxiliary patterns extracted and defined** in static development file `src/lib/auxPatterns.ts` with complete patterns for avere, essere, and stare auxiliaries across all tenses
- **Conjugation completeness specifications created** defining required building blocks for each verb type and conjugation class
- **Universal terminology mappings established** for consistent internal representation (e.g., “io” → “first-person”, “presente” → “present”)
- **Browser-based validation interface created** in admin tools section with immediate visual feedback for verb compliance assessment
- **Current state baseline analysis** showing existing data quality metrics across all validation dimensions
- **Real-time compliance reporting** displaying architectural readiness across all existing dictionary verbs with ≥95% accuracy in detecting issues
- **Actionable remediation guidance** provided for non-technical stakeholders with clear explanations and suggested fixes
- **Validation dashboard design** with intuitive workflow for identifying and resolving compliance issues
- **Automated validation rules framework** with continuous data quality monitoring and issue flagging
- **Pre-migration compliance assessment** identifying exactly which verbs and forms need attention before architectural changes begin
- **Issue prioritization system** ranking validation problems by linguistic importance and migration risk
- **Linguistic accuracy validation** for reflexive vs reciprocal constraints, auxiliary-semantic consistency, and form-translation semantic coherence
- **Admin interface usability testing** ensuring clear, actionable feedback for maintaining data quality standards
