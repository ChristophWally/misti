# Story 002.007: ConjugationEngine Integration and Modal Replacement

**Epic**: Complete Conjugation System Architectural Rebuild

**As a** learner
**I want** a new conjugation modal powered by the rebuilt engine architecture
**So that** forms display consistently based on translation selection with reliable auxiliary behavior

## Acceptance Criteria
- Existing ConjugationModal replaced with new engine-driven modal using translation-to-form architecture
- Translation selection interface implemented with real-time auxiliary switching and form filtering based on semantic meaning
- Consistent dropdown ordering across all verbs using systematic form grouping and pedagogical organization
- Pronunciation playback integrated for existing materialized forms and limited calculated gender variants
- Audio filename strategy implemented with NULL storage and future `sha256(form_id).mp3` hashing architecture
- Form filtering system applied based on translation constraints (usage, plurality, semantic type) with automatic form hiding for incompatible constructions
- Gender variant toggle dynamically enabled/disabled based on auxiliary type and tense construction requirements
- Orthographic refinement layer applying correct apostrophes, capitalization, and hyphenation to all displayed forms
- Error handling and loading states implemented for all async operations with graceful degradation
- Performance validation ensuring modal opens in under 200ms and translation switching completes in under 100ms
