# Story 002.005: Conjugation Modal Replacement and Pronunciation Playback

**Epic**: Complete Conjugation System Architectural Rebuild

**As a** learner
**I want** a new modal powered by the rebuilt engine with audio support
**So that** forms display consistently and I can hear correct pronunciation

## Acceptance Criteria
- Old `ConjugationModal` replaced with engine driven modal
- Translation selection switches auxiliaries and reposition clitics in real time
- Pronunciation playback integrated for existing forms and limited calculated variants
- Audio filename strategy uses NULL storage with future `sha256(form_id).mp3` hashing plan
- Dropdown ordering consistent across all verbs
