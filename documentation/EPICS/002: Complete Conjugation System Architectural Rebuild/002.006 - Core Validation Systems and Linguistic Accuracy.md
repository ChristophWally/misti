# Story 002.006: Core Validation Systems and Linguistic Accuracy

**Epic**: Complete Conjugation System Architectural Rebuild

**As a** developer and linguistic expert
**I want** comprehensive validation systems for data integrity and linguistic accuracy
**So that** the architecture maintains high-quality, linguistically accurate data throughout the migration

## Acceptance Criteria
- FormGapAnalyzer implemented with systematic detection of missing building blocks across verb types and conjugation classes
- LinguisticAccuracyChecker built with validation for auxiliary-semantic consistency, reflexive constraint compliance, and form-translation coherence
- TagMigrationValidator created for systematic validation of universal terminology migration and tag standardization compliance
- AuxiliaryConsistencyChecker implemented ensuring explicit auxiliary tags match both form structure and translation metadata requirements
- Architectural compliance assessment providing clear readiness metrics for future materialization engine development
- Data integrity validation across form-translation relationships, auxiliary assignments, and building block completeness
- Linguistic constraint validation for reciprocal plurality requirements, auxiliary selection rules, and reflexive semantics
- Progressive form validation ensuring stare auxiliary patterns are correctly identified and tagged
- Validation error reporting with specific remediation guidance and issue prioritization based on linguistic importance
- Continuous validation framework monitoring data quality with automated alerting for compliance regressions
