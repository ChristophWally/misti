# Story 002.003: Core Validation Systems and Baseline Analysis

**Epic**: Complete Conjugation System Architectural Rebuild

**As a** developer and linguistic expert
**I want** comprehensive validation systems implemented to establish current data state
**So that** architectural changes can be monitored for compliance and accuracy throughout the migration

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Auxiliary pattern validation logic implemented** using the auxiliary patterns from Story 002.002 to validate compound form completeness and accuracy
- **FormGapAnalyzer implemented** with systematic detection of missing building blocks across verb types and conjugation classes using mood and tense tags alone (participio + participio-passato, gerundio + gerundio-presente, infinito + infinito-presente, imperativo + imperativo-presente)
- **LinguisticAccuracyChecker built** with validation for auxiliary-semantic consistency, reflexive constraint compliance, and form-translation coherence
- **Current data state analysis completed** establishing baseline metrics for form completeness, tag consistency, and linguistic accuracy across all existing verbs
- **AuxiliaryConsistencyChecker implemented** to validate existing auxiliary patterns against defined standards and identify inconsistencies requiring resolution
- **Tag consistency audit framework** identifying existing tag standardization issues across all tables using universal terminology mappings
- **Building block requirements validation** ensuring all verb types have complete sets of required forms identified by mood and tense:
  - Past Participle — mood `participio`, tense `participio-passato`
  - Present Gerund — mood `gerundio`, tense `gerundio-presente`
  - Present Infinitive — mood `infinito`, tense `infinito-presente`
  - Base Imperative — mood `imperativo`, tense `imperativo-presente`
- **Data integrity validation** across existing form-translation relationships, auxiliary assignments, and building block completeness derived from grammatical tags
- **Linguistic constraint validation** for reciprocal plurality requirements, auxiliary selection rules, and reflexive semantics using established linguistic rules
- **Progressive form validation** ensuring stare auxiliary patterns are correctly identified in existing data using auxiliary pattern specifications
- **Irregular form detection** systematically identifying and flagging irregular past participles, gerunds, and imperatives in existing data
- **Validation error reporting** with specific remediation guidance and issue prioritization based on linguistic importance
- **Pre-migration readiness assessment** providing clear metrics on which verbs are ready for architectural changes and which require remediation
