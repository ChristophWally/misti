# Story 002.009: Tag Standardization Migration and Data Quality Assurance

**Epic**: Complete Conjugation System Architectural Rebuild

**As a** developer
**I want** to execute comprehensive tag standardization and establish ongoing data quality frameworks
**So that** the system maintains consistent, high-quality data with systematic validation processes

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Tag standardization migration executed** using validation systems with bulk update scripts for existing data
- **Universal terminology compliance** validated across `word_forms.tags`, `dictionary.tags`, and `word_translations.context_metadata`
- **Data consistency validation** ensuring all updated tags conform to standardized enumerations with backward compatibility
- **Manual verification workflow** completed for critical form and translation updates with linguistic expert review
- **Automated data quality framework** deployed with continuous validation rules and compliance monitoring
- **Performance monitoring integration** with alerting on queries exceeding 300ms threshold and database optimization validation
- **Feature flag system implemented** for gradual rollout with A/B testing capability between old and new architecture
- **Migration rollback procedures** validated with complete backup and restore workflows for each data update phase
- **Linguistic quality assurance** completed with native speaker validation for complex reflexive constructions and auxiliary assignments
- **Architectural readiness verification** showing â‰¥90% of existing verbs meet structural compliance with clear remediation paths for remaining issues
