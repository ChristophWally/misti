# Story 002.003: Verb Form Backfill and Metadata Enhancement

**Epic**: Complete Conjugation System Architectural Rebuild

**As a** developer
**I want** complete building block forms and accurate translation metadata
**So that** all verbs can generate compound forms correctly

## Acceptance Criteria
- Systematic backfill of missing past participles and gerunds for existing verbs requiring building blocks
- Translation metadata enhanced for auxiliary assignments and usage constraints in `word_translations.context_metadata`
- Gender variant calculation integrated with clitic agreement rules
- Translation constraint filtering system built with plurality restrictions
- Foundation completeness validated: all existing dictionary verbs have required past participles and gerunds
- Special validation for reflexive-verb tags and invariable forms (infinito-passato, gerundio-passato)
- Explicit foreign key relationship from `word_forms` to `dictionary` established
