# Story 002.002: Conjugation and Pronunciation Engine Foundations

**Epic**: Complete Conjugation System Architectural Rebuild

**As a** developer
**I want** core services ready for the rebuild
**So that** conjugations and pronunciation can be generated consistently

## Acceptance Criteria
- `PronunciationEngine` created with basic phonetic rules for gender variants and compounds using base word clitics only
- `ConjugationEngine` class built with extensible architecture for systematic verb form generation, designed to support future expansion beyond conjugation to dynamic sentence construction
- Auxiliary pattern caching implemented with performance monitoring
- Lookup system for irregular participles and gerunds using existing `word_forms`
- Progressive form token recognition implemented including `stare` auxiliary patterns
