# Story 002.004: Foundation Data Architecture and Universal Terminology Migration

**Epic**: Complete Conjugation System Architectural Rebuild

**As a** developer
**I want** to execute the core data architecture changes using established validation systems
**So that** the new system has clean, language-agnostic foundation with explicit relationships

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Universal terminology migration executed** across all existing `word_forms.tags` and `dictionary.tags` using mappings established in Story 002.002
- **Display layer mapping implemented** to maintain Italian-specific UI labels while using universal terms internally
- **Explicit auxiliary tags added** to all compound forms in existing `word_forms` (`avere-auxiliary`, `essere-auxiliary`, `stare-auxiliary`) using auxiliary patterns from Story 002.002
- **Direct foreign key relationship** established from `word_forms` to `dictionary` table for efficient form lookup
- **Auxiliary tag accuracy validation** ensures â‰¥99% of compound forms have correct explicit auxiliary tags matching their form structure using established validation systems
- **Irregular forms flagged** with `irregular` tag in existing `word_forms` for past participles, gerunds, and imperatives identified by validation systems
- **Migration validation** using established validation systems from Story 002.003 to ensure all changes maintain data integrity
- **Continuous monitoring** during migration using admin tools interface from Story 002.002 to catch issues immediately
- **Data consistency verification** ensuring all changes conform to established architectural standards with real-time compliance reporting
