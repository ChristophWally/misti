# Story 002.001: Database Backup and Rollback Infrastructure

**Epic**: Complete Conjugation System Architectural Rebuild

**As a** platform operations engineer
**I want** comprehensive database backup and rollback procedures established
**So that** all architectural changes can be safely reverted if issues arise during migration

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Complete Supabase database backup** executed with verified restore procedures for all tables (dictionary, word_forms, word_translations, form_translations)
- **Incremental backup strategy** implemented for each major migration phase with point-in-time recovery capabilities
- **Rollback procedures documented** with step-by-step instructions for reverting to pre-migration state
- **Backup validation testing** completed to ensure all backed-up data can be successfully restored
- **Data integrity verification** for backed-up data including row counts, constraint validation, and JSONB field integrity
- **Emergency rollback testing** executed under simulated failure conditions with time-to-recovery measurement
- **Backup storage strategy** implemented with multiple redundant copies and geographic distribution
- **Migration checkpoint system** established for creating recovery points between major architectural changes
- **Operational runbook created** with clear procedures for backup, monitoring, and emergency recovery scenarios
- **Team training completed** ensuring all stakeholders understand backup and rollback procedures
