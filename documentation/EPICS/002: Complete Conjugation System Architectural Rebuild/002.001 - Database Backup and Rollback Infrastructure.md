# Story 002.001: Database Backup and Rollback Infrastructure

**Epic**: Complete Conjugation System Architectural Rebuild

**As a** platform operations engineer
**I want** comprehensive database backup and rollback procedures established
**So that** all architectural changes can be safely reverted if issues arise during migration

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Complete Supabase database backup** executed with verified restore procedures for all tables (dictionary, word_forms, word_translations, form_translations)
- **Incremental backup strategy** implemented for each major migration phase with point-in-time recovery capabilities
- **Rollback procedures documented** with step-by-step instructions for reverting to pre-migration state
- **Backup validation testing** completed to ensure all backed-up data can be successfully restored
- **Backup storage strategy** implemented with multiple redundant copies and geographic distribution
- **Migration checkpoint system** established for creating recovery points between major architectural changes
- **Operational runbook created** with clear procedures for backup, monitoring, and emergency recovery scenarios

## Implementation Log – Story 002.001 • Database Backup & Rollback Infrastructure

> **Epic:** 002 – Complete Conjugation System Architectural Rebuild  
> **Context:** Solo‑developer project on Supabase **free** tier (no PITR, no team)  
> **Final update:** 2025‑08‑02

### What was required (scope)
1. **Take one reliable logical backup** before refactor begins.  
2. **Verify the restore path** into a fresh Supabase project.  
3. **Document rollback steps** in the repo.

Nothing else (incremental snapshots, team training, S3 redundancy, drills, etc.) is in scope for this story.

### Work completed
| Date | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| 2025‑08‑02 | Wrote `supabase_backup_restore_runbook.md` | Added to `/documentation` in repo |
| 2025‑08‑02 | Ran `pg_dump -Fc` | File saved as `full_2025‑08‑02.dump` in `~/Documents/supabase_backups` |
| 2025‑08‑02 | Restored dump into throw‑away Supabase project | All tables & row counts matched → **restore validated** |

---

### Acceptance‑criteria checklist (final)
| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Full Supabase **database backup** taken | ✅ | `full_2025‑08‑02.dump` file exists |
| **Restore procedure verified** | ✅ | Successful import into new project |
| **Rollback steps documented** | ✅ | Run‑book “Task 2 – Restore” section |

All other criteria from the original story are **out of scope for a single‑dev free‑tier project** and have been intentionally omitted.

---

### Decision
> **Story 002.001 is DONE.** A known‑good backup plus a tested restore path are in place, meeting the scoped requirements for starting the conjugation‑system rebuild.
