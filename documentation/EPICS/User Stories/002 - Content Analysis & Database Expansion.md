## Story A0: Content Analysis & Database Expansion ⭐ **[FOUNDATION STORY]**

**Priority**: Critical - Must complete before other stories  
**Estimated Time**: 60-90 minutes  
**Dependencies**: None

**As a** language learning app  
**I want** comprehensive word data with complete translations, conjugations, and metadata  
**So that** users have access to rich, accurate Italian vocabulary with proper grammatical information

### **Acceptance Criteria:**

#### **Phase 1: Content Audit (20 mins)**

- [ ] **Current inventory**: Document all 13 dictionary entries with their translation counts
- [ ] **Translation gaps**: Identify words with single translations that need multiple meanings
- [ ] **Conjugation coverage**: Map which verbs have which tenses (currently mainly present)
- [ ] **Tag completeness**: Check grammatical tag consistency across word types
- [ ] **Audio coverage**: Identify words missing premium audio filename references

#### **Phase 2: Vocabulary Expansion (40 mins)**

- [ ] **Core A1/A2 expansion**: Add 20-30 essential beginner words
  - Common nouns: famiglia, lavoro, scuola, tempo, giorno, sera, etc.
  - Essential verbs: fare, dire, sapere, volere, dovere, potere
  - Key adjectives: nuovo, vecchio, piccolo, giovane, italiano
  - Important adverbs: anche, ancora, già, mai, sempre
- [ ] **Word type balance**: Ensure good distribution across NOUN/VERB/ADJECTIVE/ADVERB
- [ ] **CEFR level tagging**: All new words properly tagged A1/A2

#### **Phase 3: Translation Expansion (30 mins)**

- [ ] **Multi-meaning words**: Add secondary translations for existing words
  - “grande” → “big, large, great” (add “great”)
  - “bene” → “well, good, fine” (add “fine”)
  - “casa” → “house, home” (already done)
- [ ] **Context metadata**: Add usage notes and restrictions for new translations
- [ ] **Display priorities**: Set proper priority ordering for multiple translations

### **Implementation Notes:**

- Use existing `TranslationAssignmentEngine` for automatic form-to-translation matching
- Follow established translation-first architecture patterns
- Ensure all new content integrates with current UI components

### **Success Metrics:**

- [ ] **40+ dictionary entries** (up from current 13)
- [ ] **60+ translations** (up from current 19)
- [ ] **15+ multi-translation words** (words with 2+ meanings)
- [ ] **100% tag coverage** (all words have complete grammatical tags)
