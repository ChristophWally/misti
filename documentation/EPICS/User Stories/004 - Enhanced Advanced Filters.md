# Story A2: Enhanced Advanced Filters

**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Time**: 45-60 minutes  
**Dependencies**: Story A0 (for more words to filter)

**As a** user exploring Italian vocabulary  
**I want** more intuitive and responsive filter controls  
**So that** I can efficiently find specific types of words I want to study

### **Acceptance Criteria:**

#### **Filter Animation & Interaction**

- [ ] **Smooth expand/collapse**: Advanced filters section with slide animation
- [ ] **Filter chip animations**: Hover effects and selection transitions
- [ ] **Mobile optimization**: Collapsible filter groups on small screens
- [ ] **Touch-friendly**: Larger tap targets for mobile devices

#### **Filter State Management**

- [ ] **Active filter badges**: Show count of applied filters in section headers
- [ ] **Clear all filters**: One-click reset button with confirmation
- [ ] **Filter persistence**: Maintain filter state during session
- [ ] **Filter combination logic**: Visual cues for AND/OR relationships

#### **Smart Filter Behavior**

- [ ] **Auto-hide empty**: Hide filter options with 0 results
- [ ] **Filter suggestions**: Suggest related filters based on current selection
- [ ] **Quick filter presets**: “A1 Verbs”, “Essential Nouns”, etc.

### **Technical Implementation:**

- Enhance `filter-utils.js` with animation utilities
- Add filter state persistence to localStorage (session-only)
