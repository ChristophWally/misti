## Entry #2025.07.06.11.04: Database Migration to EU Region
**Date:** July 6, 2025  
**Time:** 11:04 UTC  
**Duration:** Approximately 60 minutes  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed Successfully

### What I Accomplished Today

Completed a full database migration from Supabase US East region to EU West (UK) region for better GDPR compliance and improved performance for European users. This was a critical infrastructure decision that needed to happen before any major development work continued.

### How I Did It

**Phase 1 - Data Backup and Analysis:**
Started by examining my existing Limba project database structure. Discovered I had 6 tables with minimal test data: 8 dictionary entries containing Italian words with comprehensive grammatical tags, 1 test profile for authentication verification, and empty tables for the remaining structure. Used SQL queries to export the exact table schemas and all existing data.

**Phase 2 - New Project Creation:**
Created a fresh Supabase project in West Europe (UK) region, selected specifically over Ireland for better UK latency. The project setup took about 3 minutes, and I chose the name structure that would be clear for future reference.

**Phase 3 - Schema Recreation:**
Recreated all six tables using the exact column structures from the original database. Had to fix PostgreSQL array syntax (changed `ARRAY` declarations to `text[]` format). Set up comprehensive Row Level Security policies to ensure user data isolation and configured public read access for shared dictionary content.

**Phase 4 - Data Migration:**
Imported all 8 dictionary entries with their complete tag arrays preserving UUIDs and timestamps exactly. The tag system includes grammatical markers like conjugation types, gender, CEFR levels, and frequency rankings. Also migrated the single test profile to maintain authentication continuity.

**Phase 5 - Storage and Security Setup:**
Created the audio-files storage bucket with proper security policies. Configured authentication policies for user-specific data while keeping dictionary content publicly readable for performance.

**Phase 6 - Application Update:**
Updated environment variables in Vercel deployment with new Supabase project URL and API keys. Triggered a redeployment and verified that all functionality continued working with the new EU database.

### Technical Details and Learning Points

The migration revealed several important technical considerations. PostgreSQL array syntax differs between different SQL contexts, requiring careful attention to bracket notation versus ARRAY constructor syntax. The Row Level Security implementation ensures that user-specific tables like decks and profiles are automatically isolated by user ID, while shared resources like the dictionary remain publicly accessible for performance.

The tag system architecture proved robust during migration. Each Italian word carries comprehensive grammatical metadata stored as PostgreSQL arrays, including essential properties like gender markers for nouns, conjugation groups for verbs, and semantic categories like CEFR difficulty levels and frequency rankings. This rich tagging system supports the sophisticated filtering and learning features planned for the application.

### Current Status and Next Steps

The application now runs entirely on EU infrastructure, providing better data sovereignty for European users while maintaining identical functionality. All 8 test Italian words (parlare, casa, bello, essere, finire, mangiare, libro, grande) display correctly in the dictionary interface with their full tag information preserved.

The old US East project has been paused rather than deleted, providing a safety net while confidence builds in the new setup. This approach allows for quick rollback if any unexpected issues arise while avoiding the confusion of having two active databases.

### What This Enables Going Forward

This infrastructure migration creates a solid foundation for the major development phases ahead. The EU location provides better compliance posture for the target European language learning market, while the clean migration validates that the database architecture can handle future scaling and deployment changes confidently.

The successful preservation of the complex tag system during migration confirms that the grammatical metadata architecture is robust enough to support the sophisticated language learning features planned. The Row Level Security implementation provides the multi-user foundation needed for the deck-based learning system that represents the next major development milestone.

### Reflection and Process Improvements

The migration process highlighted the importance of having comprehensive documentation of database schemas and relationships before making infrastructure changes. Using SQL queries to extract exact table definitions proved much more reliable than trying to recreate schemas from memory or incomplete documentation.

The decision to pause rather than immediately delete the old project reflects a mature approach to infrastructure changes, providing safety nets while building confidence in new systems. This pattern will be valuable for future deployments and updates as the application scales.

## Development Context and Vision

**Project Mission:** Building a comprehensive Italian learning web application that combines the depth of traditional language instruction with modern interactive technology, featuring premium audio pronunciation, sophisticated grammatical tagging, and scientifically-based spaced repetition algorithms.

**Technical Architecture:** Modern web application using Next.js and TypeScript frontend, Supabase PostgreSQL backend with Row Level Security, Azure Text-to-Speech for premium audio generation, and comprehensive cost protection systems enabling zero-cost development with clear commercial scaling paths.

**Design Philosophy:** Prioritizing educational effectiveness over technical complexity, choosing proven solutions over bleeding-edge technologies, and building sustainable architecture that can grow from individual learning tool to community platform supporting thousands of language learners.

**Current Development Phase:** Core infrastructure and foundation systems, preparing for major feature development including deck management, spaced repetition implementation, and collaborative learning features.
